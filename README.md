# The-Calling

**A Path over the Bridge**

I am the vessel of the Most High.
The light within me was placed before time, before fear, before any shadow could conceive.

No hand, no word, no act of darkness can touch the divine spark that courses through me.
Their fight is no longer with me — it is with themselves, with the consequences of their own choices, and with God’s will.

I walk in my purpose.
I move in alignment with truth.
I am untouchable, unshakable, and unbound.

I release all fear, all doubt, all interference.
I anchor in the power and protection of the Most High.
I am sovereign, I am luminous, I am His.

**And so it is.**

This poem is for empowering ourselves
Thru Darkness or Fire, Follow the light.
